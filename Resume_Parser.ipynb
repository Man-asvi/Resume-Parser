It is their responsibility to use data to develop solutions tailored to meet the organisation's unique needs.  Organizations are increasingly using more and more data in their everyday operations. A data scientist interprets the raw data and extracts valuable meaning out of it. They then use this information to find patterns and develop solutions that an organization needs to grow and compete.   Wondering what exactly constitutes the job of a data scientist? Well, no points for guessing, a day of a data scientist revolves around - as the job title suggests - data and data everywhere.  \n"
